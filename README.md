# Welcome to the Expo App Test

## Test Objective

You have a simple Expo app that integrates a custom Kotlin Expo module to fetch the device's battery level. The codebase has some bugs and potential issues.

**Task**: Review the provided codebase and prioritise & fix up to 2 bugs or potential issues in each of the Expo app and the Android native module. For each improvement, breifly describe the following in dot-point form:

* Why you prioritized it.
* What could go wrong if left unfixed.
* Why you implemented the fix in the way you did.
* How you'd prevent similar issues in the future.

**Deliverables:**
* Updated code files with Git commit history (delivered via Github or ZIP file).
* The brief report listing your fixes and rationale.

## Get started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

...with a local expo module added on using the [Expo Modules API](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/third-party-library/).

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app (Android device or simulator required)

   ```bash
   expo run android
   ```
